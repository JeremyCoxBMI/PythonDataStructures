#PythonDataStructures	Python 2.7

I taught a seminar on Introduction to Data Structures for Researchers.  We have many non-computer scientists writing programs to analyze medium and large datasets.  The students in the UC Biomedical Informatics programs identified this as a key area for skills building that cannot be learned by experience.

The objectives of the seminar were
* Teach principles of data structures to inexperienced programmers.
* Equip students with vocabulary and work process to build "programs that don't run too long."
* Practice these principles by using fun Python programs. 

Here, I share the fun python programs, which include the lesson text as comments. 

As an introduction to the language for non-programmers, this activity is designed to be stress-free introduction.  Users download IDLE from python.org (version 2.7!) and then open the programs (p01 thru p10) and run them.
